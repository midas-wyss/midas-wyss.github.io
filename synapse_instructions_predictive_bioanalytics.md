## What is Synapse?

<a href="https://www.synapse.org/#" target="blank">Synapse</a> is a data sharing platform that allows individuals and teams to share and track their data and analyses in Projects. Synapse allows researchers to control who has access to each Project's data. For this reason, Synapse requires you to have a user account.

## How do I access and download data?

The one-time set-up steps required for accessing data are:

  <li> <a href="#2-request-access-to-the-predictive-bioanalytics-group">Request access to the Predictive BioAnalytics Group</a></li>
</ol>

After the above steps have been completed, you can sign in and download the data at any time from the <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Profile:3395740/projects" target="blank">project page here</a> (&larr; bookmark me).
